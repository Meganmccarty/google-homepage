# google-homepage

This project was created as part of The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).
The purpose of building it was to learn how to create simple HTML pages and style them with CSS, and I used the Google homepage as a template.
You can view the working page here: https://meganmccarty.github.io/google-homepage/
